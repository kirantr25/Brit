 Exploratory Testing
   - Test using unexpected inputs or missing required fields.
   - Verify behavior with partial updates (e.g., PATCH requests).
   - Confirm proper error handling and meaningful error messages.
   - Check for potential security issues like unauthorized access or data leakage.



Exploratory Testing Scenarios
- Sending malformed JSON or invalid data types.
- Using special characters or SQL injection patterns in inputs.
- Making requests with incorrect headers or missing authentication tokens.
- Testing concurrency with multiple simultaneous requests.
- Checking response behavior for large payloads or high-volume data.
